We describe the basics for building and applying MLD2P4 one-level and multi-level
Schwarz preconditioners with the Krylov solvers included in PSBLAS \cite{PSBLASGUIDE}.
The following steps are required:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item \emph{Declare the preconditioner data structure}. It is a derived data type,
  \verb|mld_|\-\emph{x}\verb|prec_| \verb|type|, where \emph{x} may be \verb|s|, \verb|d|, \verb|c|
	or \verb|z|, according to the basic data type of the sparse matrix
	(\verb|s| = real single precision; \verb|d| = real double precision;
	\verb|c| = complex single precision; \verb|z| = complex double precision).
	This data structure is accessed by the user only through the MLD2P4 routines,
	following an object-oriented approach.
\item \emph{Allocate and initialize the preconditioner data structure, according to
	a preconditioner type chosen by the user}. This is performed by the routine
	\verb|mld_precinit|, which also sets defaults for each preconditioner
	type selected by the user. The defaults associated to each preconditioner
	type are given in Table~\ref{tab:precinit}, where the strings used by
	\verb|mld_precinit| to identify the preconditioner types are also given.
	Note that these strings are valid also if uppercase letters are substituted by
	corresponding lowercase ones.
\item \emph{Modify the selected preconditioner type, by properly setting
  preconditioner parameters.} This is performed by the routine \verb|mld_precset|.
  This routine must be called only if the user wants to modify the default values
  of the parameters associated to the selected preconditioner type, to obtain a variant
  of the preconditioner. Examples of use of \verb|mld_precset| are given in
  Section~\ref{sec:examples}; a complete list of all the
  preconditioner parameters and their allowed and default values is provided in 
  Section~\ref{sec:userinterface}, Tables~\ref{tab:p_type}-\ref{tab:p_coarse}. 
\item \emph{Build the preconditioner for a given matrix.} This is performed by
  the routine \verb|mld_precbld|.
\item \emph{Apply the preconditioner at each iteration of a Krylov solver.}
  This is performed by the routine \verb|mld_precaply|. When using the PSBLAS Krylov solvers,
  this step is completely transparent to the user, since \verb|mld_precaply| is called
  by the PSBLAS routine implementing the Krylov solver (\verb|psb_krylov|).
\item \emph{Free the preconditioner data structure}. This is performed by
  the routine \verb|mld_| \verb|precfree|. This step is complementary to step 1 and should
  be performed when the preconditioner is no more used.
\end{enumerate}
A detailed description of the above routines is given in Section~\ref{sec:userinterface}.
Examples showing the basic use of MLD2P4 are reported in Section~\ref{sec:examples}.

Note that the Fortran 95 module \verb|mld_prec_mod|, containing the definition of the 
preconditioner data type and the interfaces to the routines of MLD2P4,
must be used in any program calling such routines.
The modules \verb|psb_base_mod|, for the sparse matrix and communication descriptor
data types, and \verb|psb_krylov_mod|, for interfacing with the
Krylov solvers, must be also used (see Section~\ref{sec:examples}).

\ \\
\textbf{Remark 1.} The coarsest-level solver used by the default two-level
preconditioner has been chosen by taking into account that, on parallel
machines, it often leads to the smallest execution time when applied to
linear systems coming from finite-difference discretizations of basic
elliptic PDE problems, considered as standard tests for multi-level Schwarz
preconditioners \cite{aaecc_07,apnum_07}. However, this solver does
not necessarily correspond to the smallest number of iterations of the
preconditioned Krylov method, which is usually obtained by applying
a direct solver to the coarsest-level system, e.g.\ based on the LU
factorization (see Section~\ref{sec:userinterface}
for the coarsest-level solvers available in MLD2P4). 

% \ \\
% \textbf{Remark 2.} The include path for MLD2P4 must override
% those for PSBLAS, i.e.\ the former must come first in the sequence
% passed to the compiler, as the MLD2P4 version of the Krylov solver
% interfaces must override that of PSBLAS. This will change in the future
% when the support for the \verb|class| statement becomes widespread in Fortran
% compilers.

\subsection{Examples\label{sec:examples}}

The code reported in Figure~\ref{fig:ex_default} shows how to set and apply the default
multi-level preconditioner available in the real double precision version
of MLD2P4 (see Table~\ref{tab:precinit}). This preconditioner is chosen
by simply specifying \verb|'ML'| as second argument of \verb|mld_precinit|
(a call to \verb|mld_precset| is not needed) and is applied with the BiCGSTAB
solver provided by PSBLAS. As previously observed, the modules \verb|psb_base_mod|,
\verb|mld_prec_mod| and \verb|psb_krylov_mod| must be used by the example program.
 
The part of the code concerning the
reading and assembling of the sparse matrix and the right-hand side vector, performed
through the PSBLAS routines for sparse matrix and vector management, is not reported
here for brevity; the statements concerning the deallocation of the PSBLAS
data structure are neglected too.
The complete code can be found in the example program file \verb|mld_dexample_ml.f90|,
in the directory \verb|examples/fileread| of the MLD2P4 tree (see
Section~\ref{sec:ex_and_test}).
For details on the use of the PSBLAS routines, see the PSBLAS User's
Guide \cite{PSBLASGUIDE}.

The setup and application of the default multi-level
preconditioners for the real single precision and the complex, single and double
precision, versions are obtained with straightforward modifications of the previous
example (see Section~\ref{sec:userinterface} for details). If these versions are installed,
the corresponding Fortran 95 codes are available in \verb|examples/fileread/|.

\end{figure}

Different versions of multi-level preconditioners can be obtained by changing
the default values of the preconditioner parameters. The code reported in
Figure~\ref{fig:ex_3lh} shows how to set a three-level hybrid Schwarz
preconditioner, which uses block Jacobi with ILU(0) on the
local blocks as post-smoother, has a coarsest matrix replicated on the processors,
and solves the coarsest-level system with the LU factorization from UMFPACK~\cite{UMFPACK}.
Figure~\ref{fig:ex_3lhm} shows how to set a three-level preconditioner similar to the one of ~\ref{fig:ex_3lh}, but the coarsest-level systems is solved with the multifrontal factorization from MUMPS~\cite{UMFPACK}. 
Note that MUMPS can be used on both replicated and distributed coarsest level matrices, 
as a global and local solver respectively.   
The number of levels is specified by using \verb|mld_precinit|; the other
preconditioner parameters are set by calling \verb|mld_precset|. Note that
the type of multilevel framework (i.e.\ multiplicative among the levels
with post-smoothing only) is not specified since it is the default 
set by \verb|mld_precinit|. 

Figure~\ref{fig:ex_3la} shows how to
set a three-level additive Schwarz preconditioner,
which uses RAS, with overlap 1 and ILU(0) on the blocks, 
as pre- and post-smoother, and applies five block-Jacobi sweeps, with
the UMFPACK LU factorization on the blocks, as distributed coarsest-level
solver. Again, \verb|mld_precset| is used only to set
non-default values of the parameters (see Tables~\ref{tab:p_type}-\ref{tab:p_coarse}).
In both cases, the construction and the application of the preconditioner
are carried out as for the default multi-level preconditioner.
The code fragments shown in in Figures~\ref{fig:ex_3lh}~\ref{fig:ex_3lhm}-\ref{fig:ex_3la} are
included in the example program file \verb|mld_dexample_ml.f90| too.

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:ex_1l} shows the setup of a one-level
additive Schwarz preconditioner, i.e.\ RAS with overlap 2. The corresponding
example program is available in \verb|mld_dexample_| \verb|1lev.f90|.

For all the previous preconditioners, example programs where the sparse matrix and
the right-hand side are generated by discretizing a PDE with Dirichlet
boundary conditions are also available in the directory \verb|examples/pdegen|.

% \ \\
% \textbf{Remark 2.} Any PSBLAS-based program using the basic preconditioners
% implemented in PSBLAS 3.0, i.e.\ the diagonal and block-Jacobi ones,
% can use the diagonal and block-Jacobi preconditioners
% implemented in MLD2P4 without  change in the code.
% The PSBLAS-based program must be only recompiled
% and linked to the MLD2P4 library.
